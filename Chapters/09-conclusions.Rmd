# Conclusions {-}

Now that we have reached the final chapter of this book, we want to discuss the main limitations and future work in the area of complex-valued economics. We focused this book on the technical side of modelling with complex-valued regressions, discussing the estimation methods, elements of correlation analysis and the main aspects of the regression analysis. We briefly discussed the complex ARIMA model, only touching on some of the important properties of it. But there is much more left outside.

For example, we discussed that complex-valued models share some properties with the multivariate ones, such as Vector AR (VAR). This means that we can use the tools developed for those models for the complex-valued ones with minor modifications. For instance, we did not discuss how to calculate Impulse Response Function, which are widely used for analysis of effects based on VAR in Economics and Marketing Analytics. We expect that these tools can be transferred to the complex-valued models easily, but they lie outside of the scope of this monograph and can be considered as a future work.

Furthermore, a curious reader might wonder what to do when we are interested in modelling more than two variables at the same time. The first instinct would be to switch to the multivariate models (VAR). But the main issue of those models is the high dimensionality. For example, VAR(p) on 10 time series requires the estimation of $p \times 10^2$ parameters, which is not a simple task. However, @SvetunkovSergey has developed a solution in this situation which involves complex variables. The model based on this is called vector cARIMA, VcARIMA(p,d,q) and involves stacking several complex response variables in a vector. This model is currently researched, and Sergey Svetunkov is preparing a paper explaining its properties and showing how it can be used for time series analysis and in forecasting.

Moreover, as discussed in this book several times, some of the largest benefits of complex variables arise when a non-linear model is considered, e.g. a log-log model. We have discussed what happens with the cLR in this situation (Subsection \@ref(assumptionsSpecificationTransformation) and Section \@ref(DynamicTrend)), but we have not yet study how the cARIMA behaves in this situation. We expect that it should be able to capture non-linear dynamics, which would be beneficial when applied to large samples of data, such as, for example, in energy domain.

In addition, the students and colleagues of Sergey Svetunkov have developed several other models relying on the theory of complex variables. These models all lie outside of the scope of this book, but they are worth mentioning for completeness.
