# Complex Linear Regression {#CLR}

## Correlations between complex random variables
When it comes to measuring associations between variables, most frequently analysts use coefficient of correlation. While it is straightforward for real-valued variables, for complex variables this become challenging, because each c.r.v. has two parts, so the correlation needs to take them both into account.

The literature knows two correlation coefficients for complex variables [@ref]: the conjugate and the direct correlation (the latter is known in the literature as "pseudo-correlation"). Their formula are based on the respective covariances and variances (conventional and pseudo discussed in Subsection \@ref(crvSecondMoment)):

1. Conventional correlation
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{x,y} = \frac{\sigma_{x,y}}{\sigma_x \sigma_y},
    (\#eq:correlationConventional)
\end{equation}

2. Complex correlation
\begin{equation}
    \varrho_{x,y} = \frac{\varsigma_{x,y}}{\varsigma_x \varsigma_y}.
    (\#eq:correlationPseudo)
\end{equation}

Note that both correlations are complex numbers, but they show different things. The correlation $\rho_{x,y}$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    {\rho}_{x,y} = \frac{\sigma_{x_r, y_r} + \sigma_{x_i, y_i} + i (\sigma_{x_i, y_r} - \sigma_{x_r, y_i})}{\sqrt{(\sigma_{x_r}^2 + \sigma_{x_i}^2)(\sigma_{y_r}^2 + \sigma_{y_i}^2)}} .
    (\#eq:correlationConventionalExpanded)
\end{equation}
As can be seen from the formula \@ref(eq:correlationConventionalExpanded), the coefficient becomes a real number only when the cross-covariances between the real and imaginary parts of $x$ and $y$ are equal. In practice, this exotic condition can be met, when the parts for both variables are not correlated. In all the other cases, the resulting correlation coefficient will be a complex number. In general, the real part of the complex correlation $\rho_{x,y}$ shows the average strength of linear relation between respective real and imaginary parts of two complex variables, while the imaginary part of $\rho_{x,y}$ shows the difference between linear relations between the cross values of real and imaginary parts of $x$ and $y$. The coefficient will be equal to zero, when there are no linear relations between the parts of complex variables $x$ and $y$.

while the second one is:
\begin{equation}
    {\varrho}_{x,y} = \frac{\sigma_{x_r, y_r} - \sigma_{x_i, y_i} + i (\sigma_{x_i, y_r} + \sigma_{x_r, y_i})}{\sqrt{(\sigma_{x_r}^2 - \sigma_{x_i}^2 + i2 \sigma_{x_r,x_i})(\sigma_{y_r}^2 - \sigma_{y_i}^2 + i2 \sigma_{y_r,y_i})}},
    (\#eq:correlationPseudoExpanded)
\end{equation}





## Simple CLR
### Model formulation
The simple Complex Linear Regression can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{z} = \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
    (\#eq:SimpleCLRComplex)
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
    y_r + i y_i = a_0 + i a_1 + (b_0 + i b_1) (x_r + i x_i) + \epsilon_r + i \epsilon_i
    (\#eq:SimpleCLR)
\end{equation}
Given that any complex equation can be represented as a system of two equations, this model can be represented as a system of two linear regressions:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        y_r = & a_0 + b_0 x_r - b_1 x_i + \epsilon_r \\
        y_i = & a_1 + b_0 x_i + b_1 x_r + \epsilon_i
    \end{aligned}
    (\#eq:SimpleCLRSystem)
\end{equation}
This model captures a very specific dynamics between the real and imaginary parts, given that they share the same set of parameters for the slope.
